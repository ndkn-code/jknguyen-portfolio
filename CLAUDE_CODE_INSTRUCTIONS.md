## "How I Work" Section (5 Steps)

**Step 1 - Discovery:** First, I dig into the problem space—user research, data analysis, stakeholder interviews. Understanding the 'why' before jumping to solutions.

**Step 2 - Define:** I translate insights into clear problem statements and success metrics. What are we solving? How do we know we've won?

**Step 3 - Design:** Rapid prototyping and iteration. Figma wireframes, user flows, and quick feedback loops with engineering and design.

**Step 4 - Build:** Sprint planning, backlog grooming, and shipping. I keep cross-functional teams aligned through daily standups and async updates.

**Step 5 - Measure:** Post-launch analytics, user feedback collection, and iteration. Every feature is a hypothesis to validate.
